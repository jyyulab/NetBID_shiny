# Tutorial for NetBIDshiny online server

The purpose of NetBIDshiny online server: 

**provide pre-generated network files from TCGA, TARGET and GTEx for quick start of NetBID2 analysis and demo datasets for quick familiar of diverse types of NetBID2 result visualization**.

The public online version of NetBIDshiny can be found here [NetBIDshiny_runner](https://yulab-stjude.shinyapps.io/NetBID2_Runner/) and [NetBIDshiny_viewer](https://yulab-stjude.shinyapps.io/NetBID2_Viewer/).

## NetBIDshiny_runner: pre-generated network files and demo usage

### GTEx

- Original transcriptome dataset from [GTEx](https://www.genome.gov/Funded-Programs-Projects/Genotype-Tissue-Expression-Project)

- We have pre-generated 96 networks from 48 tissues with each tissue has one TF network and one SIG network. 

- The original sample information could be obtained from [GTEx_Analysis_v8_Annotations_SampleAttributesDS.txt](https://storage.googleapis.com/gtex_analysis_v8/annotations/GTEx_Analysis_v8_Annotations_SampleAttributesDS.txt)

- The original gene expression profile could be obtained from [GTEx_Analysis_2017-06-05_v8_RNASeQCv1.1.9_gene_reads.gct.gz](https://storage.googleapis.com/gtex_analysis_v8/rna_seq_data/GTEx_Analysis_2017-06-05_v8_RNASeQCv1.1.9_gene_reads.gct.gz)

- Detailed network QC files could be found in [GTEx_network](tutorial4online/GTEx_network)

### TARGET

- Original transcriptome dataset from [TARGET](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/)

- We have pre-generated 102 networks from 51 cell lines with each cell line has one TF network and one SIG network.

- Detailed network QC files could be found in [TARGET_network](tutorial4online/TARGET_network)


### TCGA

- Original transcriptome dataset from [TCGA](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/)

- We have pre-generated 92 networks from 46 tumor types with each has one TF network and one SIG network.

- Detailed network QC files could be found in [TCGA_network](tutorial4online/TCGA_network)


## NetBIDshiny_viewer: demo datasets and usage

Two demo datasets are available at the online version.

1. the human MB (medulloblastoma) demo dataset from GEO database as in NetBID2: [GSE116028](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE116028), with network files generated by using the same dataset. The task was to find drivers in Group4 (G4) vs others. 

2. the mouse BPD (bronchopulmonary dysplasia) demo dataset from GEO database [GSE25286](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE25286), with network files generated by using normal human lung tissue from GTEx (human). The Task was to find drivers in BPD vs normal in P14.
